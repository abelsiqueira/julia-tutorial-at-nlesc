Julia currently has a bit over 5000 registered packages at the moment of writing.
To search among these packages, there are a few tools:

- [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages), or [JuliaPackages](https://julialang.org/packages/), or [JuliaObserver](https://juliaobserver.com/packages) - web interface to search for packages.
- [Julia.jl](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl) - a curated list of packages by field.

Furthermore, there are a few notable packages, well-known on the community (or niche community), or that I thought were interesting, that I'll list below.

- [BioJulia organization](https://biojulia.net): Bioinformatics infrastructure.
- [CSV](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/CSV/HHBkp/0.9.6): Utility library for working with CSV and other delimited files.
- [Dash](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/Dash/oXkBb/1.0.0): Julia interface to the Dash ecosystem.
- [DataFrames](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/DataFrames/AR9oZ/1.2.2): Tabular data
- [DifferentialEquations](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/DifferentialEquations/UQdwS/6.19.0): (part of SciML) Suite for high-performance solvers of differential equations.
- [DrWatson](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/DrWatson/Vn5dT/2.6.0): Scientific project assistant.
- [EcoJulia organization](https://ecojulia.org): Ecological research.
- [Flux](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/Flux/QdkVy/0.12.7): Neural Network library - from their website: _Relax! Flux is the ML library that doesn't make you tensor_.
- [Franklin](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/Franklin/04j2g/0.10.60): Static site generator. Runs and shows the output of Julia code, so it's very handy for tutorials, like this one.
- [Genie](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/Genie/8eazC/3.2.0): Julia full-stack MVC web framework.

- [Optim](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/Optim/R5uoh/1.4.1): Traditional optimizer.
- [Pluto](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/Pluto/OJqMt/0.16.1): Reactive notebooks (tip, use with [PlutoUI](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/PlutoUI/abXFp/0.7.16)).
- [SciML organization](https://sciml.ai): NumFOCUS sponsored organization with packages for scientific machine learning.
